# Networking Notes 

## Topics Learned
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** – Resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.  
- **TCP/IP Model (Transport Layer)** – Responsible for communication reliability.  
- **Checksum** – Error detection method to ensure data integrity.  
- **Timers** – Used for retransmission and connection management.  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** – Connectionless, fast, unreliable protocol.  
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** – Reliable, connection-oriented protocol.  
- **3-Way Handshake** – SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK process to establish TCP connection.  
- **Control Plane** – Responsible for routing and signaling.  
- **IP (Internet Protocol)** – Provides addressing and routing for packets.  
- **Packets** – Small units of data transmitted over the network.  
- **IPv4 vs IPv6** – 32-bit vs 128-bit addressing.  
- **Middle Boxes** – Firewalls, load balancers, etc.  
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** – Maps private IPs to public IPs.  
- **TCP (Data Link Layer)** – Handles error detection and access to the physical medium.
